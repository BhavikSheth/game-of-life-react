# My React Boilerplate
A boilerplate for creating React and Redux applications.

As many React development jobs require the knowledge of how to build an environment , I built a boilerplate from scratch for React development to learn how to configure webpack, set up testing environments, implement Babel, and more.

## Brief

* **Bundler:** Webpack
* **Linter:** ESLint
* **Testing:** Mocha, Chai, and Enzyme
* **Hot Reloading:** React Hot Loader with Webpack
* **Local Server:** Webpack Dev Server
* **CSS Preprocessor:** SASS
* **Compile ES6 to ES5:** Babel


## Get Started

1. **Clone the Project**. `git clone https://github.com/BhavikSheth/my-react-boilerplate.git`.
2. **cd into your new directory**.
3. **Install all dependencies in package.json**. `yarn`.
4. **Run the app**. `yarn start`.
