# Conway's Game of Life Application with React
Conway's Game of Life Application written in React to experiment my newly created boilerplate which can be found by clicking [here](https://github.com/BhavikSheth/my-react-boilerplate). This [FreeCodeCamp project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-the-game-of-life) was used as a starting point.

## Brief

* Create a Game of Life app that adheres to the user stories in the linked FreeCodeCamp project
* Verify that the functionality is correct according to the objective and user stories by employing unit tests
* Use linked boilerplate to create application

## Rules of Game of Life

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
